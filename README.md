This is the finished version of my password generator.
The main part of the homework was creating the generatePassword()

I completed this by added a number of different variables that required the user to confirm or reject certain password criteria that they would like to include in their passwords. 
Once the variables were created I used If statements that if they chose to add these to their password then it would concat() to the final variable allCharacters ""; which is where the password content is generated too
I also used the window.prompt to allow the user to choose their password length.
lastly a for loop was created to use the input from the user to create the password.
